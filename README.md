Factorio Utils Project

# Overview

This directory will contain an assortment of factorio utils that will help
making calculation of ratios much easier to do. The user will be able to
indicate how much of one item they will want and the generator will output a
structure of assemblers, ore inputs, and smelters to be able to generate the
item at a rate of 1 item per second.
